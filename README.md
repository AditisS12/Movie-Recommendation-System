# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **movie recommendation system** that suggests movies based on user preferences. It uses **Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization (SVD), and Similarity Measures** to generate recommendations. The system predicts movie ratings and evaluates performance using **RMSE and MAPE** metrics.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 📌 **User-User & Movie-Movie Similarity**: Finds similar users and movies for better recommendations.  
- 📌 **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on user behavior.  
- 📌 **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**: Enhances recommendations by reducing dimensionality.  
- 📌 **Error Evaluation**: Uses RMSE & MAPE to measure prediction accuracy.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise  
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MAPE  
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
